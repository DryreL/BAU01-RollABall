## Project 1: Physics and Touch Control

### Objectives:
1. **Controllable Ball**:
   - Develop a 3D environment where the player can control a ball using touchscreen input. This involves implementing touch gestures to move the ball around the scene.

### Objectives:
1. **Idle Clicker Game**:
   - Develop a simple idle clicker game where players can earn points by clicking on objects. The game should feature progressive elements that encourage player engagement.

2. **Save/Load Functionality**:
   - Implement saving and loading capabilities using PlayerPrefs, allowing players to retain their progress between sessions. This includes saving player scores and game states.

### Objectives:
1. **Visual Scripting**:
   - Learn the basics of Unity's Visual Scripting tools by using an existing Unity project. This project should include various gameplay mechanics created using visual nodes, promoting an understanding of logic without writing code.

### Objectives:
1. **Object Pooling**:
   - Implement object pooling techniques to optimize performance by reusing objects instead of instantiating and destroying them repeatedly. This project should demonstrate the efficiency and benefits of object pooling in game development.

### Objectives:
1. **Click-and-Point Game**:
   - Design a click-and-point adventure game using the DarkFantasyKit 3D asset. The project should involve creating an interactive environment with various clickable elements.

2. **GameManager Implementation**:
   - Create a GameManager C# script to manage the game state and control interactions between different objects in the scene. This script will handle game logic, object functions, and player progress.

3. **Adding Horror Elements**:
   - Incorporate horror elements into the game, such as atmospheric sounds and visual effects. Use physics to manipulate 3D objects to enhance the immersive experience for players.
